    <p> This is Super Pickle. When he is just hanging out, he only has legs, but when he is in Super Pickle mode, he has arms to help him do Super things. Super Pickle was just an ordinary pickle when one day, he was struck by lightning and from that day on he had legs and super abilities. Normal pickles all around were in awe of Super Pickle's wonderful capabilities. He was the most powerful pickle in the world. He keeps the planet safe, fighting anyone who dares to attack his home, Pickle Land. He is also Pickle President. The pickles really love him.
